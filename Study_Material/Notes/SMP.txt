1)Unicore systems
->unicore means there is only processor core which takes care of program execution
->Examples: Arduino UNO, STM32F334xx Disco

2)Multi Core systems
->having more than processor core
->Dual, Quad or more
->ESP32 is a dual core microcontroller

3)SMP
->Symmetric Multi Processing
->Usually only one task at time can aquire CPU but in case of more than one task can be active depending on how many cores present.
->ESP32 comes with dual core CPU that means two task at time can be running simultanously.

4)SMP in ESP32
->There two CPU cores CPU_0 or PRO_CPU and CPU_1 or APP_CPU
->xTaskCreatePinnedToCore is api which can be used to decide to which processor core you want your task to run on.
