1)Basic information:
->It is a Broadcast based multimaster and error detection communication protocol
->It provides message filtering feature
->Every message is associated with an ID lower the ID higher the priority

2)Messagge frame structure
->identifier 11 or 29 bits.
->Data Length Code (DLC) (0 to 8 bit)
->Upto 8 bytes of data.

3)Operating modes
i)Normal modes:
->The normal operating mode allows the CAN controller to take part in bus activities such as transmit-
ting and receiving messages/error frames. Acknowledgement from another CAN node is required when transmitting
message frames.

ii)No Ack Mode:
->The No Acknowledgement mode is similar to normal mode, however acknowledgements are not
required when transmitting message frames. This mode is useful when self testing the CAN controller.
->Use it while testing.

iii)List only Mode:
->It will restrict device to receive only without provoding acknowledgement on the bus.
->Well suited to moniter the network.

4)Alerts:

Alert								Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAN_ALERT_TX_IDLE					No more messages queued for transmission
CAN_ALERT_TX_SUCCESS				The previous transmission was successful
CAN_ALERT_BELOW_ERR_WARN			Both error counters have dropped below error warning limit
CAN_ALERT_ERR_ACTIVE				CAN controller has become error active
CAN_ALERT_RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS 		CAN controller is undergoing bus recovery
CAN_ALERT_BUS_RECOVERED				CAN controller has successfully completed bus recovery
CAN_ALERT_ARB_LOST					The previous transmission lost arbitration
CAN_ALERT_ABOVE_ERR_WARN			One of the error counters have exceeded the error warning limit
CAN_ALERT_BUS_ERROR					A (Bit, Stuff, CRC, Form, ACK) error has occurred on the bus
CAN_ALERT_TX_FAILED					The previous transmission has failed
CAN_ALERT_RX_QUEUE_FULL				The RX queue is full causing a received frame to be lost
CAN_ALERT_ERR_PASS					CAN controller has become error passive
CAN_ALERT_BUS_OFF					Bus-off condition occurred. CAN controller can no longer influence bus



5)Bit timing:   
->set the timing time quanta for a bit to be read/write on bus, basically it decides width of a bit.
->1 bit consists of multiple time quantas

6)Acceptance filer:
->Accept the frame only if it is sent from desired node by looking at it's ID, but acknowledge even if it is does not match.

7)Acceptance Code:
->Specify the pattern for ID to be received from BUS.

8)Operation Modes:
->Normal mode: Transmit, Receive frames, transmition/reception is allowed
->No Ack: There won't be acknowledgement for whether frame is transmitted or not.
->Listen only: 	not transmission no acknoledgement only reception.
